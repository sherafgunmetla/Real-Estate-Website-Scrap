# Real Estate Website Scrap

## Purpose 

I built a web scraping solution to gather property data from a real estate website for a freelance project. Utilizing Python along with libraries like Beautiful Soup and Selenium, I automated the collection of essential details such as property type, locations, Price, Location, No. of Washrooms and No. of Beds. Since the website used dynamic content, I employed Selenium to handle JavaScript rendering, ensuring smooth navigation and accurate data extraction. I implemented pagination to scrape multiple pages efficiently and incorporated error-handling mechanisms for reliability. To ensure ethical and legal compliance, I limited the scraping frequency to reduce server load and adhere to the website’s terms of service<br/> The final output was a well-structured dataset of 20,000+ properties, from a single city, tailored to the client’s requirements, enabling them to perform detailed market analysis and informed decision-making.

## Refeence 
I documented the entire process and shared my insights in a Medium article, providing a step-by-step guide for others interested in web scraping real estate data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

After gathering the data, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns within the dataset. Using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, I visualized property price distributions, analyzed correlations between features like location and pricing, and identified any missing or inconsistent data for cleaning.
